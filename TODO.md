# TODO

- [ ] Audit UI text across channels and utilities tabs for missing localization hooks.
- [ ] Wrap remaining hardcoded strings in `gui_channels.py` with `tr()` and update bindings.
- [ ] Refresh translation catalog with any new keys required for English and Vietnamese.
- [ ] Verify runtime by launching GUI to ensure new translations apply correctly.
